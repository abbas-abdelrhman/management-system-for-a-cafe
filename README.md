# Management-system-for-a-cafe (C++)

## Project Description
- The main idea of this project is to store clients' data and the data can be updated or deleted.
- I followed the way of cutting the project into small pieces.
- The code consists of:
    1. One main function
    2. Five core functions
    3. Five sub functions
- I used:
    1. Structure: to store elements
    2. Recursive function: to call the function processes again instead of while loop.
    3. Less no. of conditions, loops, and variables.
    4. Using meaning names for func. & Variables.
    5. Last but not least, I used comments to demonstrate my project.
